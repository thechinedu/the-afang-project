# The AFANG Project

Afang is a yummy vegetable soup eaten by the people of Nigeria.

It is also a rearrangement of the popular FAANG acronym used to represent some of the best performing American technology companies.

Big tech companies are known for their notoriously difficult interview process and requirement of proper computer science knowledge.

As a self-taught software developer without a CS degree (or a college degree of any kind), I must now take it upon myself to self-impart the required knowledge/skills.

This repository acts as my computer science study tracker and the project board can be found [here](http://here.com)
